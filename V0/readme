V0 version is from Markus Frejek AVR-Transistortester,. Embedded Projects Journal, 11. Ausgabe, 2011
But we can find in 2008~2010, there are already several published version in internet.Such as M8 test, which is open source too.
So I am not sure which is the initial one. Please comment it if you know this history.
